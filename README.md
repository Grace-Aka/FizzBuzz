# FizzBuzz

- Setup linters for this project

- Write a Javascript program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number between one and the number the user entered.

- When numbers that divide by 3 without a remainder are entered, print Fizz instead. 

- When numbers that divide by 5 without a remainder are entered, print Buzz.

- Finally for numbers that divide by both 3 and 5 without a remainder print FizzBuzz.
